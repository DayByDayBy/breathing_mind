Successfully updated the LFO system to reflect separate pitch1 and pitch2 parameters.

### ‚úÖ LFO Pitch Target Updates
- Split LFO pitch target into separate pitch1 and pitch2 targets
- Each LFO can now independently modulate pitch1 (oscillator 1) and pitch2 (oscillator 2)
- Updated UI to show "Pitch 1" and "Pitch 2" as separate target options
- Updated all presets to use separate pitch1/pitch2 targets
- Maintains real-time LFO target switching without audio interruption

### Technical Architecture
- Added separate gain nodes for lfo1Pitch1Gain, lfo1Pitch2Gain, lfo2Pitch1Gain, lfo2Pitch2Gain
- Updated oscillator replacement logic to handle separate pitch connections
- Modified LFO depth parameter updates to handle both pitch targets independently
- Enhanced LFOTargetControl UI component with pitch1/pitch2 options

### Previous Features ‚úÖ

- White noise generator with volume control (0 to -12dB)
- FM wave interaction with blend slider (parallel to FM crossfade)
- Complete meditation synthesizer with filters and dual LFO modulation

## Session 1: Initial Implementation & Debugging

### Challenge 1: Web Audio API Complexity
**Problem**: Initial implementation used complex Web Audio API oscillator routing with LFOs and filters, but no sound was produced.

**Approach Taken**:
- Started with standard Web Audio API approach using OscillatorNode, GainNode, BiquadFilterNode
- Connected LFOs to modulate volume and pitch
- Used complex audio graph routing

**Issues Encountered**:
- "Cannot close a closed AudioContext" errors
- No actual audio output despite proper Web Audio API setup
- Complex routing made debugging difficult

### Challenge 2: GitHub Integration Issue
**Problem**: App went blank after pushing to GitHub

**Solution**: 
- Added ErrorBoundary component to catch and display React errors
- Added debugging logs to trace component rendering
- Fixed: Was just a temporary sync issue, app recovered

### Challenge 3: Audio Still Not Working
**Decision Made**: Completely refactor to custom wave generation

**New Approach**:
- Created custom `WaveGenerator` class for mathematical wave synthesis
- Created `AudioProcessor` class for real-time effects processing
- Switched from OscillatorNode to AudioBufferSourceNode with scheduled buffers
- Custom implementations of filters and LFO modulation

**Files Created**:
- `src/utils/waveGenerator.ts` - Mathematical wave synthesis
- `src/utils/audioProcessor.ts` - Real-time audio processing
- Completely rewrote `src/hooks/useMeditationAudio.ts`

**Current Status**: 
- No build errors
- Console shows proper initialization messages
- Still no audio output - need to debug buffer generation

**Next Steps**:
- Add detailed logging to buffer generation process
- Verify AudioBuffer creation and scheduling
- Test basic sine wave generation first
- Check if gain values are being applied correctly

---

## Debugging Session - Current Issue: No Audio Output

**Symptoms**:
- Console shows "Starting tone with custom wave generation..."
- Audio context resumes successfully  
- No actual sound produced
- Other audio works on the machine

**Investigation Plan**:
1. Add buffer content logging to verify wave generation
2. Check if buffers are actually being scheduled
3. Verify gain node connections
4. Test with simplified sine wave only
5. Add audio level monitoring

**Time**: Session 1 - In Progress

### Debugging Actions Taken:
1. ‚úÖ Added comprehensive logging to `audioProcessor.ts`
   - Logs buffer creation parameters
   - Tracks maximum amplitude in generated samples
   - Shows first 10 samples and count of non-zero samples
   
2. ‚úÖ Added scheduling debugging to `useMeditationAudio.ts`
   - Logs buffer duration, schedule time, and gain values
   - Tracks timing relationships
   
3. üîÑ Added detailed sample generation tracking
   - Monitors wave mixing process
   - Verifies mathematical wave generation is producing non-zero output

**Expected Next Steps**:
- Run with new logging to identify if:
  - Buffers are being generated with actual audio data
  - Scheduling is working correctly  
  - Gain nodes are set to proper values
  - Audio context is properly connected to output

**Time**: Current debugging session

## Debugging Update: AudioContext closed prevented sound
- Observation: Console showed "Audio context state: closed" with GainNode/connection warnings when pressing Play.
- Root cause: We were reusing a previously closed AudioContext (likely after HMR/unmount), so new nodes couldn't be created or connected.
- Fix: Updated initializeAudioContext to recreate a new AudioContext when ref is null or state === 'closed'; resume if 'suspended' during start.
- Scheduling tweak: Adjusted buffer scheduling lookahead to avoid negative delays and ensure smooth sequencing.
- Expectation: Context reliably opens on Play; audio output should be audible now.

Next steps if still silent:
- Inspect gain at runtime and temporarily set volume to 0.8 to verify headroom.
- Consider increasing buffer size or reducing CPU load if glitches occur.

## Deep Debugging Session: Comprehensive Audio Diagnostics
Based on colleague's Web Audio API troubleshooting tips, adding extensive debugging:

1. **Test oscillator bypass**: Added simple 440Hz sine wave test to verify AudioContext functionality
2. **Gain debugging**: Replaced smoothTransition with linearRampToValueAtTime to rule out transition issues
3. **Buffer data inspection**: Logging buffer contents to verify AudioProcessor generates non-zero samples
4. **Timing verification**: Enhanced scheduling logs to check start/stop timing accuracy
5. **State validation**: More detailed AudioContext state logging

**Expected outcome**: This will identify whether issue is in AudioContext setup, gain control, buffer generation, or scheduling.

## Simplified Oscillator Test Implementation
Following colleague's advice to eliminate complexity and isolate the core issue:

1. **Added simple OscillatorNode test**: Created `startSimpleTone()` function using basic Web Audio API
2. **Bypassed complex buffer system**: Temporarily using OscillatorNode ‚Üí GainNode ‚Üí Destination chain
3. **Immediate audio test**: Should produce continuous sine wave at current pitch/volume settings
4. **Cleanup integration**: Added proper stop/disconnect handling for oscillator nodes

**Purpose**: This eliminates custom buffer generation, scheduling complexity, and AudioProcessor entirely. If this produces sound, we know:
- AudioContext works properly
- Gain nodes function correctly  
- Audio output chain is connected
- Issue is in AudioProcessor.createProcessedBuffer() or scheduling logic

**Next**: If simple oscillator works, can decide whether to fix AudioProcessor or enhance OscillatorNode approach with filters/modulation.

## Major Architectural Refactor: Native Web Audio Synth
Based on feedback to eliminate custom buffer generation complexity, completely refactored to use native Web Audio API:

### New Architecture:
1. **Created `meditationSynth.ts`**: Native Web Audio synth engine using OscillatorNode + filters + gains
2. **Refactored `useMeditationAudio.ts`**: Replaced AudioProcessor/buffer scheduling with synth-based approach
3. **Audio Graph**: Oscillator1 + Oscillator2 ‚Üí Gains ‚Üí LowPass ‚Üí HighPass ‚Üí MasterGain ‚Üí Destination
4. **LFO Modulation**: Two LFOs for volume/pitch modulation using native oscillator connections
5. **Real-time Control**: Direct parameter updates via Web Audio API nodes

### Benefits:
- **Eliminated custom buffer generation**: No more AudioProcessor complexity
- **Native performance**: Uses optimized Web Audio API oscillators/filters
- **Immediate audio**: No buffer scheduling delays or gaps
- **Reliable output**: Web Audio API handles all audio generation internally
- **Real-time updates**: Direct node parameter control for volume changes

### Functionality Maintained:
- Two oscillators with selectable wave types
- Individual oscillator volume controls  
- Low-pass and high-pass filters with resonance
- Two LFOs targeting volume or pitch
- Master volume with smooth transitions
- All existing UI controls work identically

**Expected Result**: Instant, continuous audio output with no buffering issues. Much more reliable than custom wave generation.

- Osc2 acts as carrier in FM mode, receives frequency modulation from Osc1
- Smooth parameter updates with real-time crossfading between modes
- FM modulation scaled by 100x for audible effect

**User Experience:**
- New "FM Blend" slider shows "Parallel", "X% FM", or "Full FM"
- Real-time morphing between traditional additive synthesis and FM synthesis
- Enables creating metallic, bell-like, and complex harmonic textures
- All existing controls (filters, LFOs, volume) work in both modes

**Files Modified:**
- `src/utils/meditationSynth.ts` - Added FM routing architecture
- `src/hooks/useMeditationAudio.ts` - Added fmBlend parameter handling
- `src/components/MeditationToneGenerator.tsx` - Added FM blend UI control
